        <br><br><strong><i class="fa fa-spinner"></i>Lets end this short introductory by his few sayings:</strong><br><p class="quo"><i class="fa fa-quote-left	
            "></i>
            Whatever it is that is pulling you back, is not going away unless you stand up and start forging your path in the opposite direction. Stop whining and start moving.<br><br>
            <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>Whatever you’re doing, do it once, then do it one more time, even more carefully. Practice will make everything seem easier. Be diligent, be thorough, think of every job you do as the first one.
            <br><br>
            <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
            Don’t let your fears become boxes that enclose you. Open them out, feel them, and turn them into the greatest courage you are capable of.
            <br><br> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
Money is a good thing to run after. It is very important to be financially stable but you have to keep your wrongs and rights in mind. Don’t shy away from earning but without selling your soul.
<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
There is no such thing as normal. Normal is just another word for lifeless.
